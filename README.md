# RouteBetweenNodes
Exercise related with Trees and Graphs.

## Exercise Challenge
Given a directed graph and two nodes (S and E), design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route from S to E.

### Solution
I have implemented the solution with a BFS search. 
I begin searching from one of the nodes and, if I find the other node (means there is a path) I return true, otherwise, I return false.
